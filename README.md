# 🔮  Illusiva

A magical number illusion app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that amazes users by "reading their mind" using a clever mathematical trick and a beautifully animated UI.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Mind Reading Illusion** based on a math trick with two-digit numbers  
- 💫 **Elegant and modern design** with glassmorphism and glowing effects  
- 🎭 **Suspenseful reveal animation** for a dramatic user experience  
- 🔢 **Dynamic number grid** with randomly assigned symbols  
- ⚡ Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks or libraries required

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Think of any two-digit number (e.g. 42).
2. Add both digits (4 + 2 = 6).
3. Subtract the sum from the original number (42 - 6 = 36).
4. Look up the symbol next to your new number on the grid.
5. Hit the "Reveal" button — the app magically shows the symbol you were thinking of! 🪄

> It works because the result is always a multiple of 9, and all multiples of 9 share the same symbol.
